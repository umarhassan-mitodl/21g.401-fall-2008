Classes
-------

Meet four times a week: MTRF. Regular attendance is mandatory. More than 5 absences will automatically affect your final grade.

Language Lab
------------

Please record the time you spend working with the different parts of the audio program both in the lab and at home on the log sheet provided. The log sheet will be collected by the instructor with the workbook/lab manual. (Audio/Video set for textbook is catalogued under GE 213)

Audio Program
-------------

**Regular daily work with the audio program for short periods of time (15-20 minutes) is strongly suggested.** For the listening exercises, you may also work from your computer at home, given that you have a microphone installed to your home computer. The audio program files are available to registered students through the course Web site. For the DL recorder, go to {{% resource_link "a1bd9488-c623-476a-9818-c24f123e0c90" "Dartmouth College Language Recorder" %}}. You will receive additional information on the DL recorder and the audio files on the first day of class.

Homework
--------

Maximum of 8 hours per week. This includes **daily** practice with the audio program.

**It is crucial that you work regularly with the audio program in order to practice listening to your own recorded voice in comparison with the voices of the native speakers.**
